Collection of Flash-games created by me around 2010-2011.
Flash is now deprecated technology and this repo stands as a memory of the games created by me. 

## Everybody Loves Me

## Road to Zombie Village
A 2D roleplaying hack n' slash game where the main character faces against hordes of zombies. Level up and strenghten your character!

## Gladiator game
The character from Everybody Loves Me is back! Now he is placed in a gladiator arena where he have to survive waves of enemies. To be able to come out of this alive, the main character needs to collect gold and experience points to buy new gear and level up his abilities.
